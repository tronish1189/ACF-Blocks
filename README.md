# ACF-Blocks

An example of how I set up ACF Blocks on one of my sites.

Basically, you register the Blocks in functions.php and map to the specific Block files in template-parts.

Every block probably doesn't need its own folder, but that's how it was set up in the example on ACF so I didn't mess with it.
